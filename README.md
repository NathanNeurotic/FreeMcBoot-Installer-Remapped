 Custom installers for FreeMcBoot 1.966, 1.965, 1.953, 1.964 and 1.963

They're packed with updated software.

In addition, several enhancements were made:
+ Installer:
  - Forbid multi install (corrupts memory card filesystem and doesn't achieve anything different than normal install)
  - Renamed normal install options to be user friendly
  - added manual HDD format option
  - added variant of installer that can be launched from exfat USB
+ Installation package:
  - updated Kernel patch updates for SCPH-10000 & SCPH-15000 to the one used on FreeMcBoot 1.966
  - Updated FreeHdBoot FSCK and MBR bootstraps to the one used on FreeHdBoot 1.966
  - added console shutdown ELF to all versions prior to 1.966
  - Optional custom IRX files to make FreeMcBoot/FreeHdBoot support EXFAT USB storage devices
  - internal HDD APPS partition header data changed to allow KELF execution from HDD-OSD.
